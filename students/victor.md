## Victor

Hi, my name is *Victor*!

I starting coding when I was 10, and messed around with HTML, CSS, and C++
without really knowing what I was doing.

Fast forward to 2023, I am now working on my [own
company](https://perchlook.com) and teaching at
[open camp](https://opencamp.cc).

Looking forward to meeting all of you!
