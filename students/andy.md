Hi, my name is Andy and I'm a student at your coding bootcamp. I'm excited to
be here and to learn how to code. I've always been interested in computers and
technology, but I've never had the opportunity to learn how to code before. I'm
hoping that this bootcamp will give me the skills I need to get a job in the
tech industry.
